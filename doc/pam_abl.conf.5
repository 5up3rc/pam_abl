.SS "Rule syntax"
.sp
Each rule consists of a number of space separated \fIuser clauses\fR\&. A user clause specifies the user (and service) names to match and a set of triggers\&. A simple example would be
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
*:10/1h
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
which means \fIblock any user (\fR\fI\fB) if they are responsible for ten or more failed authentication attempts in the last hour\fR\fR\fI\&. In place of the \fR\fI\fR which matches any user a list of usernames can be supplied like this
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
root|dba|admin:10/1h
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
which means \fIblock the users root, dba and admin if they are responsible for ten or more failed authentication attempts in the last hour\fR\&. You can also specify a service name to match against like this
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
root/sshd|dba/*:3/1d
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
which means \fIblock the users root for service \*(Aqsshd\fR and dba for any service if they are responsible for three or more failed authentication attempts in the last day\*(Aq\&. Finally you can specify multiple triggers like this
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
root:10/1h,20/1d
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
which means \*(Aqblock the user root if they are responsible for ten or more failed attempts in the last hour or twenty or more failed attempts in the last day\&.
.sp
Multiple rules can be provided separated by spaces like this
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
*:10/1h root:5/1h,10/1d
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
in which case all rules that match a particular user and service will be checked\&. The user or host will be blocked if any of the rule triggers matches\&. The sense of the user matching can be inverted by placing a \fI!\fR in front of the rule so that
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
!root:20/1d
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
is a rule which would match for all users apart from root\&. It is important to treat root as a special case in the user_rule otherwise excessive attempts to authenticate as root will result in the root account being locked out even for valid holders of root credentials\&. The config file can contain any arguments that would be supplied via PAM config\&. In the config file arguments are placed on separate lines\&. Comments may be included after a \fI#\fR and line continuation is possible by placing a back slash at the end of the line to be continued\&. Here is a sample /etc/security/pam_abl\&.conf:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# /etc/security/pam_abl\&.conf
debug
host_db=/var/lib/abl/hosts\&.db
host_purge=2d
host_rule=*:10/1h,30/1d
user_db=/var/lib/abl/users\&.db
user_purge=2d
user_rule=!root:10/1h,30/1d
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
All of the standard PAM arguments (debug, expose_account, no_warn, try_first_pass, use_first_pass, use_mapped_pass) are accepted; with the exception of debug and no_warn these are ignored\&.
.sp
The arguments that are specific to the PAM module are as follows:
.PP
\fBdb_home\fR
.RS 4
Specify the directory where the Berkeley db can store it\(cqs lock and log files\&. Make sure this dir exists and is writable\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlimits\fR
.RS 4
It\(cqs value should have the following syntax "<minimum>\-<maximum>"\&. If you do not block machines that do too many attempts, the db can easily become bloated\&. To prevent this we introduced this setting\&. As soon as there are a <maximum> number of attempts for a user/host, the number of stored attempts for this user/host is reduced to <minimum>\&. A <maximum> of 0 means no limits\&. Make sure that <minimum> is larger then any rule specified\&. We recommend a value of "1000\-1200"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBhost_db, user_db\fR
.RS 4
Specify the name of the databases that will be used to log failed authentication attempts\&. The host database is used to log the hostname responsible for a failed auth and the user database is used to log the requested username\&. If host_db or user_db is omitted the corresponding auto blacklisting will be disabled\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBhost_purge, user_purge\fR
.RS 4
Specify the length of time for which failed attempts should be kept in the databases\&. For rules to work correctly this must be at least as long as the longest period specified in a corresponding rule\&. You may wish to retain information about failed attempts for longer than this so that the pam_abl command line tool can report information over a longer period of time\&. The format for this item is a number with an optional multiplier suffix,
\fIs\fR,
\fIm\fR,
\fIh\fR
or
\fId\fR
which correspond with seconds, minutes, hours and days\&. To specify seven days for example one would use
\fI7d\fR\&. Note that in normal operation pam_abl will only purge the logged data for a particular host or user if it happens to be updating it, i\&.e\&. if that host or user makes another failed attempt\&. To purge all old entries the pam_abl command line tool should be used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBhost_rule, user_rule\fR
.RS 4
These are the rules which determine the circumstances under which accounts are auto\-blacklisted\&. The host_rule is used to block access to hosts that are responsible for excessive authentication failures and the user_rule is used to disable accounts for which there have been excessive authentication failures\&. The rule syntax is described in full below\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBhost_clr_cmd, host_blk_cmd, user_clr_cmd, user_blk_cmd\fR
.RS 4
These specify commands that will run during a check when an item switches state since its last check\&.

host_clr_cmd and user_clr_cmd will run if the host or user is currently allowed access\&. host_blk_cmd and user_blk_cmd are run if the host or user is currentlybeing blocked by their respective rules\&. If no command is specified, no action is taken\&.

Within the commands, you can specify substitutions with %h, %u and %s, which will be replace with the host name, user name and service currently being checked\&. If there isn\(cqt enough information to fulfill the requested substitutions (eg\&. running the pam_abl tool without specifying all the necessary fields), the command will simply not run\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBhost_whitelist, user_whitelist\fR
.RS 4
;\-seperated list of hosts/users whose attempts will not be recorded\&. So if an attempt is made from "10\&.10\&.10\&.10" for user "root" and "root" is in the whitelist, only an attempt for his machine is recorded\&. If a user is whitelisted, this does not prevent his machine from being blocked\&. Hosts can be specified using their IP (1\&.1\&.1\&.1) or using a netmask (1\&.1\&.1\&.1/24)
